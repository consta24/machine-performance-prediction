# Machine Performance Prediction

This repository contains two Python scripts for predicting machine performance using two different regression models: Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Files

- `linear_regression.py`: This script uses Linear Regression to predict machine performance.
- `decision_tree_regression.py`: This script uses Decision Tree Regression to predict machine performance.

## Usage

- Both scripts load the dataset, preprocess it, train the respective regression model, evaluate the model, and plot the results for comparison.

- The scripts will output the coefficient of determination R^2, mean squared error, and test variance score. Additionally, two plots will be displayed: "Ground Truth vs Predicted" and "Test vs Prediction" for visual analysis of the model's performance.
